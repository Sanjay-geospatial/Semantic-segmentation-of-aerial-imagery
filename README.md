Introduction
Semantic segmentation of aerial imagery is vital for urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster management, and autonomous navigation. This project uses a ResNet-based encoder-decoder CNN to achieve precise pixel-wise classification, offering a robust solution for understanding complex aerial scenes.

Features
ResNet Backbone: Leverages pre-trained ResNet models (e.g., ResNet-50, ResNet-101) for robust feature extraction.

Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Implements a U-Net-like structure for both high-level semantic and fine-grained spatial details.

Customizable Training: Easily configure parameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs.

Data Augmentation: Improves model generalization through various augmentation techniques.

Evaluation Metrics: Supports standard metrics: IoU, Dice Coefficient, and pixel accuracy.

Inference Script: Predicts segmentation masks on new aerial images.

Model Architecture
Our semantic segmentation model employs an encoder-decoder architecture.

Encoder
The encoder uses a pre-trained ResNet model (e.g., ResNet-50/101) for powerful feature extraction. ResNet's skip connections mitigate vanishing gradients, and ImageNet pre-trained weights provide a strong starting point.

Decoder
The decoder upsamples low-resolution features from the encoder, reconstructing the high-resolution segmentation mask. This involves:

Upsampling layers: Increase spatial resolution (e.g., transposed convolutions).

Skip connections: Concatenate encoder features to recover fine-grained spatial information, leading to precise boundaries.

The decoder outputs a pixel-wise prediction map, followed by a softmax activation for final class predictions.
